Interest</p><p class="section1__text">For each open Transaction made at the end of the Company's business day, a corresponding financing charge may be applied to the relevant TFI. In this case, this fee is paid either by the Client directly to the Company or by the Company to the Client, depending on the type of TFI and the position of the Client. The method of calculating the finance charge varies depending on the type of TFI to which it is applied. In addition, the amount of the finance charge depends on current interest rates (such as LIBOR). The financing fee is deducted from the Account or credited to the Customer's Account (depending on the situation) on the day following the day of its accrual.</p><p class="section1__text">The company reserves the right to change the method of calculating the financing charge, the amount of financing rates and / or types of TFIs to which the financing charge applies. In the case of certain types of PFIs, the Client pays a fee for opening and closing a PFI position. The amount of the commission is debited from the Client's Account at the moment when the Company opens the corresponding PFI. The company can calculate and change the interest rate swaps rates set by the Company at its discretion and without notice. Customers need to constantly monitor the current rates on the Company's website. Rates may change rapidly due to changing market conditions (changes in interest rates, volatility, liquidity, etc.) and various issues related to risks that the Company decides at its discretion.</p><p class="section1__text">For products with a floating spread, a fixed commission is applied in accordance with the List of Requirements. The commission is fixed for each contract and each stage (unilaterally). The Company reserves the right to change the size of the commission and shall not be liable for losses incurred by the Client as a result of a change in the size of the commission. In the case of products with a floating spread and commission, please periodically carefully review the list of requirements. The company is not responsible for changing the size of the floating spread or commission.</p><h4 class="section1__textheader">6. RIGHT TO CANCEL AGREEMENT</h4><p class="section1__text">The Client may cancel this Agreement within 14 (fourteen) days from the date of its signing or its receipt by the Client (whichever is later) (hereinafter the “Term of Cancellation”).

DISCLAIMER OF THE PROVISION OF RECOMMENDATIONS</h4><p class="section1__boldtext">Execution only</p><p class="section1__text">The Company only fulfills the instructions of the Client and does not provide recommendations regarding the advantages of a particular Transaction or its tax consequences. The Company may, upon request, provide the Client with free information materials indicating their source. These materials should not be taken as a recommendation, advice or guarantee. The client independently decides whether to rely on the received information. This information is not a recommendation regarding cash management or investments. Using the Company's Services, the Client acknowledges, understands and accepts this.</p><p class="section1__boldtext">Own assessment. Product availability</p><p class="section1__text">Without prejudice to the above obligations, in order to conclude a Transaction, the Client declares that it has independently and under its responsibility carried out an independent risk assessment of the Transaction. The Client declares that he has sufficient knowledge, experience and professional advice for self-assessment of the benefits and risks of any Transaction, and that the Client has read and accepts the Risk Disclosure and Management Statement for the underlying asset available on the Company's website. The Company does not provide guarantees regarding the suitability of the products provided under this Agreement, and does not assume any fiduciary obligations to Customers.</p><p class="section1__boldtext">Information as a by-product</p><p class="section1__text">If the Company provides the Client with general information, market information or other information:</p><p class="section1__text">- this information is a by-product of the business relationship of the parties. It is intended solely to help the Client to make an independent decision and is not a recommendation;</p><p class="section1__text">- if the information is provided in the form of a document containing a clause regarding the person or persons for whom this document is intended or addressed, the Client agrees not to transfer it to any other persons;</p><p class="section1__text">- the Company does not make statements and does not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of this information or regarding the tax consequences of any Transaction;</p><p class="section1__text">- the Client agrees that from the moment of sending this information the Client must use it or act on its basis. The Company does not make statements regarding the time when the Client receives this information and cannot guarantee that the Client will receive it simultaneously with other Clients. Any published analytical reports or recommendations may appear on one or several information boards.</p><h4 class="section1__textheader">8. CLIENT ACCOUNTS AND INITIAL DEPOSITS</h4><p class="section1__boldtext">Documents</p><p class="section1__text">Before submitting a request to the Company, the Client is obliged to read and accept this Agreement, including the Risk Disclosure Statement, policies and procedures described in clause 9 below and all existing applications, the Client’s Account must have sufficient net funds and the Company must approve the Client registration form and all related documents.</p><p class="section1__text">The minimum amount of the initial deposit is $ 250 or the equivalent amount in another currency (in accordance with the currency of the Customer's Account). Notification of registration will be sent to the Client by e-mail or published on the site.</p><p class="section1__text">At its discretion, the Company may require that, in addition to accepting the Agreement online, the Customer signs and submits any documents requested by the Company, including, but not limited to, this Agreement and the Risk Disclosure Statement.</p><p class="section1__boldtext">Invoice Currency</p><p class="section1__text">You can open a trading account (s) in US dollars, euros, Russian rubles or any other currency offered by the Company. The balance of the Account (s) will be calculated and reported to the Client in the currency of the Account (s).</p><h4 class="section1__textheader">9. POLICIES AND PROCEDURES</h4><p class="section1__boldtext">Transfer of orders</p><p class="section1__text">The Client may transfer orders to the Company in electronic form via the CORPINVEST LTD Online System. If you receive any instructions by phone, computer or other means, the Company may ask the Client to confirm them in writing. In any case, the Company will be authorized to execute the Client's order, even if the Client does not confirm it in writing. In this Agreement, the words “order” and “request” have the same meaning.</p><p class="section1__boldtext">Valid query types</p><p class="section1__text">Some (but not all) types of requests received by the Company are listed below:</p><p class="section1__text">Valid until the notice of cancellation (Good till Canceled (“GTC”)) - any request (other than a market one) that, by virtue of its conditions, is valid until it is executed or canceled by the Client. Such requests are not canceled automatically at the end of the working day on which they were submitted.</p><p class="section1__text">Limit Request - any request (other than a market one) to buy or sell a specific contract at a specified price. A limit purchase request is usually executed when the asking price becomes equal to or lower than the suggested price specified by the Client in the request. A limit sales request is executed when the bid price becomes equal to or higher than the asking price specified by the Customer in the request.</p><p class="section1__text">Market Request — A request to buy or sell a specific contract at the current price specified in the Company's Online System. The purchase request is executed at the current asking price of the contract, and the request for sale is executed at the current proposed price of the contract.</p><p class="section1__text">Interchangeable Request (One Request Cancels the Other Request (“OCO”)) - a request associated with another request. Running one of the queries automatically cancels the other.</p><p class="section1__text">Stop Loss Request - an order to buy or sell a contract at a price lower than the initial price of an open position (or lower than the prevailing price when submitting a stop loss request for an already open position). It is used to protect against damages. Please note that due to the price gap, the best available price you can get may differ significantly from the price specified in the stop loss request. Thus, the request stop loss does not necessarily bring the desired result at the price indicated in it.</p><p class="section1__text">Trailing Stop Request is the same as stop loss, with the difference that instead of setting a price that activates a request, a sliding stop request is activated at a fixed distance from the price.</p><p class="section1__text">For example, if the Client bought a long open position and the market asking price of the contract has increased, the moving stop price will also increase and will follow the market asking price of the contract at a distance specified by the Client. If the market asking price then decreases, the moving stop price stops at its last position, and when the market asking price reaches the moving stop price, the request will be fulfilled. Please note that due to the price gap, the best available price that can be obtained may differ significantly from the price indicated in the moving stop request.
