block page-text
  p All Clients and potential Clients are obliged to carefully study the following risk warning prior to the end of registration on the Website or at the trading terminal and prior to commencement of Transactions. The purpose of this Risk Warning (hereinafter referred to as the “Warning”) is to disclose to the Client information about the risks associated with conducting transactions in financial markets, in general, and performing operations with options, in particular, to alert the Client about possible financial losses associated with these risks. The list of risks listed in this Warning is not exhaustive due to the variety of possible situations that arise when performing these operations. This warning is informative in nature and is intended to explain in general terms the nature of the risks associated with trading options.
  p 1. The client acknowledges that the execution of transactions with options is a speculative and highly risky investment and is suitable only for those investors who:
  p - understand and are prepared to take on economic, legal and other risks;
  p - taking into account their personal financial circumstances, financial resources and life obligations, they are able to afford the risk of losing the invested amounts;
  p - have sufficient knowledge to understand what constitutes the execution of transactions with options.
  p The company does not provide the Client with any recommendations or advice regarding options and does not provide investment recommendations of any kind. The client independently decides on a trading strategy and specific actions, based either on his own understanding of the market, or on consultations received from financial consultants independent and not affiliated with the Company. Options are derivative financial instruments whose price is derived from the value of the prices of the underlying assets / markets to which they are tied (for example: currency, stock indices, stocks, metals, futures, etc.). In this regard, it is extremely important for the client to understand the risks associated with the trade of the underlying underlying asset / market. Some of these risks are:
  p - Volatility - movements in the price of the underlying asset / market can be unstable and unpredictable. This fact has a direct impact on the financial results of the Client. Understanding market volatility allows the Client to analyze potential profits and develop a trading strategy.
  p - Market fluctuations - a sudden change in the price of the underlying asset from one level to another. Various factors can lead to dramatic changes (for example, economic events or market announcements). The appearance of such factors is possible both with the open market and with the closed one. When these factors occur when the market is closed, the price of the underlying asset at the opening of the market after the appearance of such a factor may differ markedly from the price of the underlying asset at the time of closing the market. In this case, it may not be possible to close an open position at a bargain price. This situation can lead to significant losses and significant profits.
  p - Liquidity: the value of options may depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, changes in the supply-demand ratio, government, agricultural, commercial and trade programs and strategies, national and international political and economic events, and the prevailing psychological mood in the relevant market .
  p Market conditions may vary significantly over a very short period of time, and therefore, under certain market conditions, it may not be possible for the Client to obtain a planned profit.
  p 2. The client assumes the risks of financial losses due to malfunctions, interruption of actions, disconnection or malicious actions of third parties in relation to information, communication, electrical, electronic and other systems used to perform operations. Among other risks, the Client assumes the following risks of damages caused by: - disconnection of electricity and / or equipment on the side of the Client or telecom operator (including voice communications) of the Client;
  p - physical damage (or destruction) of communication channels used to communicate the Client’s provider and the supplier (carrier) and the Client’s server;
  p - disconnecting (unacceptably low quality) transmissions through the channels used by the Client, or channels used by the supplier or telecom operator (including voice communications), which are used by the Client;
  p - use of communication channels, equipment and software, creating a risk of non-receipt or untimely receipt of messages (including text messages) by the Client from the Company;
  p - shutdown (unacceptably low quality) of communication through the channels used by the Company, in particular physical damage (destruction) of communication channels by third parties.
  p 3. The customer understands that his transaction activities may be at risk from network risks, including the failure of hardware, software, servers, communication lines, and Internet failure. The result of any such failure may be the fact that its disposal may not be carried out in accordance with its instructions. The company is not liable in the event of such a refusal.
  p 4. The Client understands that the Internet may be the subject of events that may affect its access to the Company’s website and the trading terminal, including but not limited to, interruptions or disconnection of software and hardware failures, Internet outages, power outages or hacker attacks. The Company shall not be liable for any damage or loss resulting from such events that are beyond its control or for any other losses, expenses, obligations (including, but not limited to, loss of profits) that may arise as a result of the Client’s inability to access Company site or delay or refusal to send orders.
  p 5. When performing trading operations using the trading terminal, the Client assumes the risks of financial losses that may arise as a result of:
  p - failures in hardware, software, device failure and poor communication quality on the side of the Client;
  p - improper operation of the Customer’s equipment.
  p 6. The client acknowledges that in market conditions other than normal, the processing time of client orders may increase.
  p 7. The client acknowledges that there can be only one request or order in the request / order queue on the server. An attempt to send any new request or order will be rejected.
  p 8. The client acknowledges that the only reliable source of information on asset rates is the Company's server. Asset rates in the Client’s trading terminal cannot serve as a reliable source of information about the courses, as in the case of an unstable connection between the Client’s trading terminal and the Company’s server, some of the asset price quotes may not reach the Client’s trading terminal.
  p 9. The Client acknowledges that closing the web browser window does not cancel the order or request already received by the Company for processing.
  p 10. The client assumes the risk of performing unplanned trade operations in the case of re-sending the order before receiving the information on the result of processing its previous order.
  p 11. The client assumes the risk of any financial losses caused by the fact that he did not receive or received with a delay any message from the Company.
  p 12. The client acknowledges that the information sent by e-mail (e-mail) in an unencrypted form is not protected from unauthorized access.
  p 13. The client is solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the information received by him from the Company, and assumes the risk of any financial losses caused by unauthorized access by third parties to his trading account.

  p - strikes, riots or civil unrest, terrorist acts, wars, natural disasters, accidents, fires, floods, storms, hurricanes, power outages, communication, software or electronic equipment, which according to the Company's reasonable opinion led to the destabilization of the market or markets of one or more tools;
  p - suspension of work, liquidation or closure of any market or the absence of any event on which the Company bases quotes, or the introduction of restrictions or special or non-standard terms of trade, as well as conducting operations in any market or in relation to any such event.
  p 15. The client assumes financial and other risks in the event that the implementation of operations (and related actions) in the financial markets is prohibited or restricted by the laws of the client's country of residence.
  p 16. The Company does not guarantee that the Client’s activity in making transactions with options is not or will not be subject to taxation in the future. The client is solely responsible for paying any taxes and / or any other fees that may be charged in respect of his transactions. The Company will not provide the Client with any legal, tax or other recommendations related to any transaction. The client should seek independent advice if he has any doubts as to whether he can undertake any tax liabilities.
  p 17. The Company does not bear any responsibility for any actions or omissions of any third party through which the funds sent by the Client to replenish the current Account of the Client, or when the Client withdraws funds from the site, will pass.
  p 18. The Company may, from time to time and at its discretion, provide the Client with information, recommendations, news, comments or other information about the market, as information for information. If this happens:
  p - the company will not be responsible for such information;
  p - the company does not guarantee the accuracy, correctness and completeness of such information;
  p - this information is provided solely to enable the Client to make their own investment decisions, and does not constitute investment advice;
  p - if the document contains a restriction on the person or category of persons for whom this document is intended, or for whom it is distributed, the Client agrees that he will not pass this information to such person or category of persons;
  p - the company does not guarantee that the client will receive information until such information is no longer relevant. The client independently makes a decision regarding the use of the received information when making decisions. The information posted by the Companies may be changed or deleted at any time without further notice to the Client.
  p 19. The company will not advise the Client about the profitability of a transaction or provide investment advice in any form other than providing information about the current state of the financial market. At the same time, the Trading Signals provided by the Company to the Client within the framework of the Agreement are not an offer and do not serve as a direct recommendation to the Client for trading and (or) concluding transactions, and also are not objective and reliable information for which the Company is responsible to the Client and third parties, and do not constitute professional advice. The client alone, at his own risk, will enter into transactions and make appropriate decisions based on his own judgment. By sending a transaction order to the Company, the Client confirms that he is fully responsible for his own independent assessment and investigation of the risks of the transaction. The client confirms that he has enough market knowledge, has received professional advice, if necessary, and has the necessary experience to make his own assessment of the merits and risks of any transaction. Considering the above, the Company recommends the Client to carefully consider whether the risks arising from the operations are acceptable, taking into account the objectives and financial capabilities of the Client. This Warning is not intended to force the Client to refuse to perform transactions (transactions with options), but is intended to help the Client assess the risks associated with these transactions and responsibly address the issue of choosing an activity strategy as part of the execution of the Agreement entered into with the Company.
