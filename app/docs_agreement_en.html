              <p>27. STRUGGLE AGAINST WASHING</p>
              <p>
                Broker
                <span class="company-brand"></span>
                is actively involved in the fight against money laundering. Broker
                
                <span class="company-brand"></span>
                complies with the rules of the Joint Anti-Money Laundering Group in the UK. This state is a member of the FATF (Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering), an intergovernmental organization that is engaged in the prevention of money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
              </p>
              <p>
                Broker
                <span class="company-brand"></span>
                has developed certain rules that prevent money laundering. These rules include:
              </p>
              <p>- Receipt of verified customer identification data;</p>
              <p>- storage of identity records;</p>
              <p>- checking those who open accounts for involvement in terrorism by checking them on lists of known or suspected terrorists;</p>
              <p>- informing customers that the information they transmit will be used to verify their identity;</p>
              <p>- tracking customer cash transactions;</p>
              <p>- refusal to accept cash, money transfers, third-party transactions, Western Union transfers.</p>
              <p>Money laundering refers to a situation in which funds obtained from illegal or criminal activities are conducted through the financial system in order to legitimize the source of these funds.</p>
              <p>The process of money laundering usually takes place in three stages:</p>
              <p>- money or its equivalent is transferred to the financial system (organization);</p>
              <p>- then money is transferred to other accounts (for example, futures) through several transactions in order to hide the origin of money (using transactions with minimal risks or their absence, or transferring money to other accounts);</p>
              <p>- at the last stage, the money is returned to the economy in such a way that it gives the impression of their legal origin (for example, the trading account of the broker is closed and the funds are transferred to a bank account).</p>
              <p>Using trading accounts is just one of the options for laundering funds or trying to hide the true owner of funds. In particular, trading accounts can be used to conduct financial transactions in order to hide the origin of money.</p>
              <p>
                As a preventive measure
                <span class="company-brand"></span>
                conducts the withdrawal of funds only by the same method by which they entered the trading account.
              </p>
              <p>The company sends the findings to the source from which they were obtained, as a preventive measure.</p>
              <p>International rules on countering money laundering require organizations providing services to be careful with accounts that can be laundered and taken to prevent it, detect and send a special report on suspicious activity.</p>
              <p>28. Withdrawal of funds</p>
              <p>A withdrawal request is made only through your personal account on the site and must be confirmed by the manager assigned to the client via voice confirmation or in written format if there is a problem with the service provider. This confirmation applies to all clients of the company, considering VIP status. After confirmation, withdrawals will be made within 7-10 business days.</p>
              <p>29. COMMISSIONS FOR DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS</p>
              <p>30. PROHIBITED ACTIONS:</p>
