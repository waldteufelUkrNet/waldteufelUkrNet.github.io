                        advertisements. Client Agreement This client agreement is entered by and
                        between the operator of the Borman Corp side (the “Company”) and the
                        person or legal entity that has applied to open a trading account at the
                        Company’s CFD’s Trading platform (the “Client”),according to the terms
                        and conditions detailed herein.</p>
                    <p>Introduction:</p>
                    <p>1.1 This agreement, as well as any legally binding document entered
                        into between the Company and the Client, all as amended from time to
                        time (together: the “Agreement”), set out the terms upon which the
                        Company will deal with the Client in respect to placing orders and
                        trading over financial instruments, on the Company’s trading platform.</p>
                    <p>1.2 Trading, means that a contract is being created which gives the
                        Client the right to estimate the direction of change in price of an
                        underlying asset, within a specified time frame determined by the
                        Company. This trading instrument is different from trading in
                        traditional options, since there is a fixed return that is determined at
                        the outset of the trade, there is usually no Stop-Loss order and other
                        features.</p>
                    <p>1.3 Opening an account and usage of the Trading Platform provided by
                        the Company is by limited license given by the Company to the Client.
                        The license is personal, non-transferable and is for persons who are
                        older than 18 years old (or older legal age, if the law applicable to
                        the Client’s jurisdictions requires a higher legal age) and subject to
                        this Agreement. The Client may not transfer, assign, or enable other to
                        make any use of the license, and/or give the Clients access codes to the
                        Trading Account to anyone. Any damage caused to the Client, the Company
                        and any third party due to breach of this Agreement by Client, shall be
                        under the Client’s sole responsibility.</p>
                    <p>1.4 All services are provided to the client by <strong>, </strong>which is the management company and the client enters into a contractual agreement with Borman Corp only.</p>
                    <p>Opening of the Trading Account:</p>
                    <p>2.1 The Company will open an account for the Client (the “Trading
                        Account”) as soon as reasonably practicable after: (i) the Company has
                        received confirmation that the Client has agreed to enter into this
                        Agreement (such confirmation can be made by checking the “I AGREE”
                        button or link on the Company’s Internet website (the “Website”),
                        followed by a completed application form (if applicable) and all other
                        Client’s information required by the Company to be provided for full
                        verification. The Client confirms that Client’s information is full,
                        accurate and complete. If there is a change in the information provided
                        by the Client at any time, the Client must notify the Company
                        immediately of any such change.</p>
                    <p>2.2 The Trading Account will be activated by the Company as soon as
                        the Company has identified the funds credited by the Client to the
                        Trading Account. The Company may activate the Trading Account and permit
                        trading in the Trading Account subject to such limitations, and before
                        full verification has been determined, and to the satisfaction of such
                        further requirements as the Company may impose. In the event that the
                        Trading Account is activated but any such requirements are not complied
                        with, the Company may freeze activity in the Trading Account. Where a
                        Trading Account is not activated or is frozen, no funds held by the
                        Company in respect of that Trading Account may be transferred back or to
                        any other person until the Company is satisfied that all Applicable
                        Regulations have been complied with.</p>
                    <p>2.3 In relation to any Transaction entered into pursuant to the
                        Agreement the Company may act, according to the Company’s sole
                        discretion, as principal or as agent on the Client’s behalf. Therefore
                        the Company may act as the counter party to the Clients Trading
                        activity. The Client confirms that it acts as principal and not as agent
                        or trustee on behalf of someone else.</p>
                    <p>2.4 The Client hereby represents and warrants that his engagement
                        with the Company in this Agreement and his use of the Company’s services
                        are in full compliance with the law applicable to the Client.</p>
                    <p>Trading Platform:</p>
                    <p>3.1 The Trading Platform supplied by the Company enables trading in
                        foreign exchange rates of different currencies, commodities, and any
                        other financial instruments made available by the Company (all hereof:
                        “Financial Instruments”). The Trading Platform displays indicative
                        quotes of exchange rates of different financial instruments pairs, based
                        on different financial information systems, as the most updated
                        exchange rates in the international capital markets. For determining the
                        quotes for different time periods, the platform is making mathematical
                        calculations according to known and accepted capital markets formulas.
                        It is acknowledged by both Parties that due to different calculation
                        methods and other circumstances, different trading platforms and/or
                        markets may display different price quotes.</p>
                    <p>3.2 The Client will receive a predetermined pay-out if his
                        transaction expires in-the-money, and he will lose a predetermined
                        amount of his investment in the Transaction if the option expires
                        out-of-the-money. The predetermined amounts are a derivative of the
                        collateral invested in the transaction by the Client, and will be
                        published in the Trading Platform. The degree to which the option is
                        in-the-money or out-of-the-money does not matter as it does with a
                        traditional options.</p>
                    <p>3.3 The Company does warrant that trading in the Trading Account will be available at all times.</p>
                    <p>3.4 The Client authorises the Company to rely and act on any order,
                        request, instruction or other communication given or made (or purporting
                        to be given or made) by the Client or any person authorised on the
                        Client’s behalf, without further enquiry on the part of the Company as
                        to the authenticity, genuineness authority or identity of the person
                        giving or purporting to give such order, request, instruction or other
                        communication. The Client will be responsible for and will be bound by
                        all obligations entered into or assumed by the Company on behalf of the
                        Client in consequence of or in connection with such orders, requests,
                        instructions or other communication.</p>
                    <p>3.5 The Company has the right, but not the obligation, to set, at its
                        absolute discretion, limits and/or parameters to control the Client’s
                        ability to place orders or to restrict the terms on which a Transaction
                        may be made. Such limits and/or parameters may be amended, increased,
                        decreased, removed or added to by the Company and may include (without
                        limitation): (i) controls over maximum order amounts and maximum order
                        sizes; (ii) controls over total exposure of the Company to the Client;
                        (iii) controls over prices at which orders may be submitted (including,
                        without limitation, controls over orders which are at a price which
                        differs greatly from the market price at the time the order is submitted
                        to the Company’s order book); (iv) controls over any electronic
                        services provided by the Company to the Client (including ,without
                        limitation, any verification procedures to ensure that any particular
                        order or orders has come from the Client); or (v) any other limits,
                        parameters or controls which the Company may be required to. The Company
                        may, in addition, require the Client to limit the number of open
                        Transactions which the Client may have with the Company at any time.</p>
                    <p>3.6 The Company does not allow actions or non-actions based on
                        arbitrage calculations or other methods that are based on exploitation
                        of different systems or platforms malfunction, delay, error etc.</p>
                    <p>3.7 The Company is entitled, by its own discretion, to cancel any
                        trade that has been executed due or in connection with an error, system
                        malfunction, breach of the Agreement by Client etc. The Company’s
                        records will serve as decisive evidence to the correct quotes in the
                        world capital markets and the wrong quotes given to the Client; The
                        Company is entitled to correct or cancel any trade based according to
                        the correct quotes.</p>

                        authentic SWIFT confirmation, stating full bank account details and

                        not being credited to the Client’s Trading Account.</p>
