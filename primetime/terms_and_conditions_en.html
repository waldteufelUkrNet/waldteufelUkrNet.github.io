<span class="company-name"></span>
Online System. If you receive any instructions by phone, computer or other means, the Company may ask the Client to confirm them in writing. In any case, the Company will be authorized to execute the Client's order, even if the Client does not confirm it in writing. In this Agreement, the words “order” and “request” have the same meaning.</p><p class="section__boldtext">Valid query types</p><p class="section__text">Some (but not all) types of requests received by the Company are listed below:</p><p class="section__text">Valid until the notice of cancellation (Good till Canceled (“GTC”)) - any request (other than a market one) that, by virtue of its conditions, is valid until it is executed or canceled by the Client. Such requests are not canceled automatically at the end of the working day on which they were submitted.</p><p class="section__text">Limit Request - any request (other than a market one) to buy or sell a specific contract at a specified price. A limit purchase request is usually executed when the asking price becomes equal to or lower than the suggested price specified by the Client in the request. A limit sales request is executed when the bid price becomes equal to or higher than the asking price specified by the Customer in the request.</p><p class="section__text">Market Request — A request to buy or sell a specific contract at the current price specified in the Company's Online System. The purchase request is executed at the current asking price of the contract, and the request for sale is executed at the current proposed price of the contract.</p><p class="section__text">Interchangeable Request (One Request Cancels the Other Request (“OCO”)) - a request associated with another request. Running one of the queries automatically cancels the other.</p><p class="section__text">Stop Loss Request - an order to buy or sell a contract at a price lower than the initial price of an open position (or lower than the prevailing price when submitting a stop loss request for an already open position). It is used to protect against damages. Please note that due to the price gap, the best available price you can get may differ significantly from the price specified in the stop loss request. Thus, the request stop loss does not necessarily bring the desired result at the price indicated in it.</p><p class="section__text">Trailing Stop Request is the same as stop loss, with the difference that instead of setting a price that activates a request, a sliding stop request is activated at a fixed distance from the price.</p><p class="section__text">For example, if the Client bought a long open position and the market asking price of the contract has increased, the moving stop price will also increase and will follow the market asking price of the contract at a distance specified by the Client. If the market asking price then decreases, the moving stop price stops at its last position, and when the market asking price reaches the moving stop price, the request will be fulfilled. Please note that due to the price gap, the best available price that can be obtained may differ significantly from the price indicated in the moving stop request. Thus, a rolling stop query does not necessarily bring the desired result at the price indicated in it.</p><p class="section__text">After the submission of the request, the Client is obliged to stay in touch to receive notifications of acceptance and execution of the request and other messages about the status of the Customer's Account until all open requests are fulfilled. Thus, the Client must constantly monitor his Account in the presence of open positions / requests.</p><p class="section__text">The validity of the Client's request will depend on the type and time of the request. If the validity period or the expiration date / time of the request is not specified, the request will have an unlimited validity period.</p><p class="section__boldtext">Request Acceptance Conditions</p><p class="section__text">The client is obliged to clearly indicate the conditions of the request being submitted, whether it be a market, limit, stop loss or any other request, including the corresponding price and the size of the contract. The Client acknowledges and agrees that, despite the Company's efforts, the price at which the request is executed may differ significantly from the price indicated in the request. This may be caused by sudden fluctuations in the price of the underlying asset, which the companies are not subject to. The company is not responsible for the inability to fulfill the request. The Company has the right (but is not obliged) to refuse completely or partially any request prior to its execution or to cancel any request if the margin on the Customer’s Account is not sufficient to fulfill the entire request or if the request is illegal or otherwise incorrect.</p><p class="section__boldtext">Query Policy</p><p class="section__text">The company is obliged to comply with the policy of fulfilling requests and provide its Clients with the necessary information related to the policy of fulfilling the requests of the Company.

The size of the initial margin may be small in relation to the value of the derivatives, so that the Transactions are “mobilized” or “adapted”. A relative small price movement may have a proportionately greater effect on the funds that the Customer has deposited or will need to deposit. This can work against or in favor of the Client.</p><p class="section__text">The company reserves the exclusive right to expand its floating spreads, adjust leverage, change its renewal ratios and / or increase margin requirements without notice in certain market conditions, including but not limited to when the office is closed, around major announcements, in result of changes in credit markets and / or during periods of extreme volatility. In such circumstances, the Client agrees to indemnify the Company for any and all losses that may arise as a result of spreads and leverage adjustments.</p><p class="section__boldtext">Execution of requests</p><p class="section__text">The Company will make reasonable efforts to immediately fulfill any request, however, accepting the Customer’s request, the Company does not approve or guarantee that such a request can be executed at all or that it can be executed in accordance with the Customer’s instructions.
